To start with **Phase 1 (Basic Implementation)** in the **Java version** of your project, we will structure 
the project in a simple way, and as we proceed, we can expand it. Here's how you can set up the folders and 
files within your root project folder `DroneSurveillanceJava`.

### **Basic Folder and File Structure**:

1. **Root Folder (`DroneSurveillanceJava/`)**
    - This is your main project folder.

2. **Subfolders**:
   - **`src/`**: Contains the source code for the project.
   - **`lib/`**: Optional, but good practice if you plan to include any external libraries later.
   - **`assets/`**: You’ll place map images, mock data files (if needed), or other resources here.

3. **Main Java Classes** (under `src/`):
   - **`Main.java`**: The main class to run the program.
   - **`Drone.java`**: The class simulating the drone’s movement and sensor data acquisition.
   - **`ObjectDetection.java`**: The class that simulates detecting humans and vehicles.
   - **`MapVisualization.java`**: The class responsible for visualizing the map and the detected objects.

---

### **Folder/File Breakdown**:

1. **`src/` Folder**:
   - Create a subfolder `drone/` for your package. All Java classes will reside here.
   - Inside `drone/`, create the following Java files:
   
     ```bash
     DroneSurveillanceJava/
     ├── lib/                 # For external libraries (optional)
     ├── assets/              # For map images, etc.
     └── src/
         └── drone/
             ├── Main.java          # Main entry point
             ├── Drone.java         # Simulates drone movement
             ├── ObjectDetection.java # Simulates detecting humans/vehicles
             └── MapVisualization.java # Handles map rendering
     ```

2. **File Descriptions**:

   - **`Main.java`**:
     This will serve as the entry point of the application. It will initialize the drone and start the tracking simulation.

     ```java
     package drone;

     public class Main {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Drone drone = new Drone();
             drone.startSimulation();
         }
     }
     ```

   - **`Drone.java`**:
     This class will simulate the drone's movement across a map grid. Initially, it will move in a random pattern 
	 and detect objects in its range.

     ```java
     package drone;

     public class Drone {
         private int posX, posY; // Drone's position on the map
         private static final int GRID_SIZE = 100; // Simulated map grid

         public Drone() {
             // Start the drone at the center of the grid
             this.posX = GRID_SIZE / 2;
             this.posY = GRID_SIZE / 2;
         }

         // Method to start the simulation
         public void startSimulation() {
             System.out.println("Starting drone simulation...");
             for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                 moveDrone();
                 detectObjects();
                 MapVisualization.display(posX, posY);
             }
         }

         // Simulates random drone movement
         private void moveDrone() {
             // Randomly move the drone up, down, left, or right
             this.posX += (int)(Math.random() * 10 - 5); // Move in X direction
             this.posY += (int)(Math.random() * 10 - 5); // Move in Y direction

             // Ensure the drone stays within the grid
             this.posX = Math.max(0, Math.min(posX, GRID_SIZE));
             this.posY = Math.max(0, Math.min(posY, GRID_SIZE));

             System.out.println("Drone moved to position: (" + posX + ", " + posY + ")");
         }

         // Placeholder for object detection (to be developed in later phases)
         private void detectObjects() {
             System.out.println("Detecting objects...");
             // Detection logic will go here in later phases
         }
     }
     ```

   - **`ObjectDetection.java`**:
     This class will later simulate the detection of humans and vehicles. For now, we can leave it as a placeholder, but 
	 eventually, it will contain logic to randomly generate objects in the drone’s path.

     ```java
     package drone;

     public class ObjectDetection {
         // Placeholder for object detection logic
     }
     ```

   - **`MapVisualization.java`**:
     This class will visualize the drone’s movement. For now, it will just print the drone’s coordinates. Later, we will 
	 add more complex visualization (using JavaFX or a graphical library).

     ```java
     package drone;

     public class MapVisualization {

         public static void display(int posX, int posY) {
             System.out.println("Drone at: (" + posX + ", " + posY + ")");
             // In the future, graphical rendering of the map and objects will be added here.
         }
     }
     ```

### **Steps to Implement Phase 1**:

1. **Initialize the Project**:
   - Open VSCode, navigate to your project folder (`DroneSurveillanceJava`), and set up your workspace.
   - Ensure you have the **Java Extension Pack** installed in VSCode to support Java projects.

2. **Create the Folder Structure**:
   - Manually create the folders `src/drone/`, `lib/`, and `assets/`.
   - Add the `.java` files as shown in the structure above under `src/drone/`.

3. **Run the Program**:
   - Compile and run the `Main.java` class.
   - The output should show the drone moving randomly on a grid, with its coordinates printed after each move.

### **Next Steps for Phase 1**:
   - After you confirm the basic movement simulation is working, the next step will be adding mock object detection 
   logic in the `ObjectDetection.java` file.
   - Later, we’ll integrate a map or grid visualization for displaying the drone’s movements.

This setup provides a solid foundation for the drone simulation, and we'll build on it by adding object detection, 
map visualization, and classification in subsequent phases. Let me know if you'd like to proceed to any specific feature next!
